The management of the University of Ilorin (UNILORIN) has revised its earlier directive on the relocation of campus parks following constructive engagements between the Students’ Union and members of the university community.

According to a statement released by the Students’ Union, the adjustment aims to make transportation within the university more convenient and affordable for students and staff. The move reflects the University’s responsiveness to student concerns and underscores the impact of dialogue and responsible advocacy.

#### **Highlights of the Revised Transport Arrangement**

* All commercial vehicles will continue to drop passengers at the new park near the university gate.
* Passengers may alight at the old park; however, commercial buses are not permitted to pick passengers from that location.
* Only university-operated shuttles are authorized to pick passengers from the old park.
* Tricycles (Keke NAPEP) will now operate from the open space around the Students’ Union Building and Bukateria area.
* The newly established bus stop opposite the Faculty of Education has been cancelled.

#### **Fare and Economic Adjustments**

* The fare from Tanke Terminus to the university campus remains ₦200.
* The fare from the new park to campus (using university-operated buses) is now ₦100.

The revised arrangement will operate on an interim basis for two to three weeks while the university management reviews and finalizes the long-term transportation plan.

The Students’ Union expressed appreciation to the university authorities for their consideration and assured students of its continued commitment to welfare, safety, and convenience.

> “We remain steadfast in representing the interests of all Innovative Unilorites with dignity and fairness,” the Union stated, urging students to remain patient and cooperative as the new measures take effect.

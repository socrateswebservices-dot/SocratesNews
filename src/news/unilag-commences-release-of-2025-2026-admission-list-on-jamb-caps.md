The University of Lagos (UNILAG) has started updating the 2025/2026 admission list on the Joint Admissions and Matriculation Board (JAMB) Central Admissions Processing System (CAPS).

Currently, many candidates are seeing *“Admission in Progress (AIP)”* on their portals. Applicants whose CAPS has not yet reflected AIP are advised to remain calm and patient, as the process is ongoing and updates will continue to roll out gradually.

Once a candidate’s status changes to *“Congratulations, you’ve been admitted,”* they are required to promptly accept the admission offer.

Congratulations in advance to all admitted candidates!

The Academic Staff Union of Universities (ASUU), Adekunle Ajasin University, Akungba-Akoko (AAUA) Chapter, has threatened to disrupt the planned resumption of students and the forthcoming convocation ceremony if their outstanding salaries and arrears are not paid.

The lecturers, under the umbrella of ASUU, embarked on strike last month over what they described as the non-payment of their entitlements by the Ondo State Government. The industrial action has since paralysed academic and social activities on campus.

According to report gathered, the Chairman of AAUA ASUU, Dr. Boluwaji Oshodi, stated that members had exercised enough patience but could no longer endure the alleged neglect.

He lamented that lecturers had been forced to carry out their duties under difficult conditions, including conducting examinations “on an empty stomach.” According to him, all efforts to secure a meeting with Governor Lucky Aiyedatiwa had proved abortive.

Reacting to the development, the Ondo State Commissioner for Education, Science and Technology, Prof. Igbekele Ajibefun, dismissed claims that the government had abandoned the institution.

He explained that the state government had been in constant engagement with the striking lecturers to resolve the dispute and assured that the issues would soon be addressed.

Prof. Ajibefun further noted that Governor Aiyedatiwa’s administration had consistently released monthly subventions to all state-owned tertiary institutions, including AAUA, without delay.

The management of the Federal University Dutse (FUD) has begun uploading the 2025/2026 admission list on the Joint Admissions and Matriculation Board (JAMB) Central Admissions Processing System (CAPS).

Currently, some candidates are noticing the message “Admission in Progress (AIP)” on their JAMB CAPS profiles. The university has advised applicants whose portals have not yet displayed this update to remain patient, as the process is ongoing and being implemented in batches.

Successful candidates will see their status change to “Congratulations, you’ve been admitted” once their admission is confirmed. They are then expected to accept the offer promptly on the JAMB CAPS platform to validate their admission.

The university reassured all applicants that the admission process is being handled with transparency and in accordance with JAMB’s official guidelines.

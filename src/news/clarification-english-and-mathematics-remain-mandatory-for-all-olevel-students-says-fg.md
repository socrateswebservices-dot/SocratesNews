The Federal Government has stepped in to quell public confusion, reaffirming that English Language and Mathematics remain compulsory subjects for all students registering for their O'Level examinations, despite the recently announced reforms to tertiary institution admission criteria.

The clarification was issued on Sunday by the Federal Ministry of Education following widespread misinterpretation of a new policy that appeared to relax the Mathematics requirement for Arts and Humanities admissions.

The Ministry stressed that the new admission framework does not exempt any student from having to register for or sit for the two core subjects.

According to a statement signed by the Director of Press and Public Relations, Boriowo Folasade, the Minister of Education, Dr. Maruf Tunji Alausa, explained that the reform's primary goal is to promote flexibility, inclusiveness, and fairness in the admission process.

"The streamlining ensures that deserving students are not denied access to higher education due to credit deficiencies in subjects that are not directly relevant to their chosen fields of study," Alausa stated.

He clarified the distinction: while the new framework allows institutions to admit candidates into specific programmes especially in the Arts department even if they lack a credit pass in one of the core subjects (like Mathematics), this adjustment only affects the admission criteria, not the fundamental secondary school curriculum.

"All students must continue to take both subjects as part of their Senior School Certificate Examinations, as they remain vital components of a sound educational foundation," the statement read.

In essence, students must still study and sit for the examinations, even if certain tertiary programmes may no longer insist on a credit pass in that subject for entry.

The Ministry concluded by urging students, parents, and education stakeholders to rely solely on official communication channels for accurate updates on education reforms, reiterating its commitment to maintaining the quality and integrity of the education system while promoting equitable access.

The National Examinations Council (NECO) has inaugurated a new Senior School Certificate Examination (SSCE) centre in London, marking a significant stride in its global expansion strategy to provide credible assessment opportunities for Nigerians in the diaspora.

The new centre, unveiled at the Education Matters Conference UK 2025, is the result of a partnership between NECO and Barnfield Education Ltd. It is designed to offer a crucial academic pathway for Nigerian students and adult learners in the UK seeking to complete their secondary education or obtain equivalent qualifications.

NECO's Registrar and Chief Executive, Professor Dantani Ibrahim Wushishi, stated the initiative aligns with the Federal Government's policy on inclusivity and global engagement.

"The initiative aims to provide credible and accessible examination opportunities for Nigerians residing abroad," Prof. Wushishi said.

This strategic move extends NECO's global footprint to seven countries, with two more centres awaiting accreditation in Egypt and Burkina Faso.

The London centre is expected to promote national pride and strengthen the global recognition of NECO certificates. Currently, NECO qualifications are already accepted by several prestigious institutions across the globe, including:

* United Kingdom: Birmingham City University and Leeds Trinity University.
* Other Countries: Universities in the United States, Canada, India, China, and Russia.

The Minister of Education, Dr. Tunji Alausa, commended NECO for the effort, describing it as a vital step toward ensuring that "no Nigerian child, at home or abroad, is left behind."

The Director of BEP Education and NECO's UK partner, Dr. John Ibanga, highlighted the centre's role as an alternative pathway for Nigerian students in the UK who face challenges navigating the British education system.

The Nigerian High Commission in London also praised the development, with the Head of Political Affairs, Ambassador Eche Abu-Obe, calling it a "timely and commendable effort" consistent with Nigeria's policy on educational inclusivity and diaspora engagement.

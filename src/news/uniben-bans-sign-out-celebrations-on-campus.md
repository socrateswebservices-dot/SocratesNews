The management of the University of Benin (UNIBEN) has imposed a total ban on all forms of sign-out celebrations by graduating students within its campuses.

The directive, issued in a circular signed by the University Registrar, Mr. Ademola Bobola, followed a management meeting held on Monday, where the earlier resolution of the University Senate prohibiting such activities was reaffirmed.

According to the circular, any student found participating in sign-out activities will face severe disciplinary actions, which may include rustication, expulsion, or withdrawal of certificate.

The university also warned against indiscriminate parades around campus in any type of vehicle, stating that unauthorised vehicles will be denied entry throughout the final week of the second-semester examinations.

In addition, the circular prohibits large gatherings around faculties, schools, and institutes after examinations and bars photographers from mounting stands or galleries for sign-out photo sessions.

Parents and guardians of final-year students were advised to avoid visiting the campus during the closing days of examinations, especially on the final day.

Mr. Bobola explained that the decision was taken to preserve order, discipline, and academic decorum within the university environment.

With this decision, UNIBEN joins several other Nigerian universities including Nnamdi Azikiwe University (UNIZIK), Federal University, Lafia, Ibrahim Badamasi Babangida University, Kaduna Polytechnic, and the University of Port Harcourt (UNIPORT) that have recently placed restrictions or outright bans on sign-out celebrations.

Sign-out celebrations, typically involving the signing of white shirts, music, and social gatherings, have become a popular but often rowdy tradition among final-year students marking the end of their studies.\

The West African Examinations Council (WAEC) has reaffirmed its readiness to conduct the first ever Computer-Based West African Senior School Certificate Examination (CB-WASSCE) scheduled to hold in 2026.

Speaking during a nationwide sensitization exercise held on Wednesday across WAEC’s key centers in Yaba, Ojo, Ikeja, Ikorodu, Maryland, and Surulere, the Head of the Nigeria National Office, Dr. Amos Dangut, said the Council has put in place comprehensive measures to ensure a seamless, credible, and technology-driven examination process.

Dr. Dangut explained that the CB-WASSCE represents a major leap in WAEC’s modernization efforts, as the examination body transitions from the traditional paper-and-pencil format to a fully computer-based assessment model. He noted that the move aligns with WAEC’s long-term goal of enhancing efficiency, transparency, and global competitiveness in examination delivery.

“All candidates who register for the 2026 CB-WASSCE, whether in Nigeria or abroad, will have no difficulty sitting for the examination,” Dr. Dangut assured. “This system will significantly reduce examination malpractice, improve logistics, and boost candidates’ confidence and performance.”

Addressing public concerns about the removal of certain subjects from WAEC’s Continuous Assessment (CASS) portal, Dr. Dangut clarified that only trade subjects officially discontinued by the government were taken off the platform.\
“For example, Auto Merchandising has been removed because it no longer exists as a recognised subject,” he explained, adding that while a few subjects had been renamed, their core curriculum content remains unchanged.

He further reiterated WAEC’s dedication to innovation and educational advancement, stating:

> “WAEC is a responsible and law-abiding institution committed to harnessing technology for improved learning and assessment. Our goal is to position Nigeria among nations that fully embrace digital examinations.”

The Council assured students, parents, and school administrators that all identified technical and logistical concerns are being addressed ahead of the 2026 CB-WASSCE rollout, emphasizing that the forthcoming exam will mark a new era in West African education assessment.

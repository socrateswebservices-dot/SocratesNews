The student union of Unilorin officially released a press statement regarding the  increase in school fees for this academic session. They explained that there have been concerns about the fees, and considering the economic implications for university colleagues, it is imperative to clarify this issue.

They further explained that there has been no increment in the school charges itself. The amount that every student pays as school fees remains the same. However, some charges that were previously paid separately have now been consolidated into a single fee. The immediate past administration of the Union initially advocated for this consolidation. The aim was to eliminate hidden charges and promote transparency in the fee structure.

The consolidated fee includes charges that were previously paid separately by students in various faculties and departments. The total amount may appear higher in certain departments because of this consolidation. However, in other departments with no such charges, the total fee remains as it was last session.

Thereafter, the union assured the students that they are working tirelessly to ensure that the charges are fair and reasonable so that no Unilorite has to pay any further charges beyond the consolidated amount.

The Union will continue further engagements with the University Management on the issue while also promising that all Unilorites would be notified promptly about any resolutions reached.\

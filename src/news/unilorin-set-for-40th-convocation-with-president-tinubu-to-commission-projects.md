The University of Ilorin (UNILORIN) is gearing up for its landmark 40th Convocation Ceremony, a week-long celebration that will be highlighted by the visit of President Bola Ahmed Tinubu, who is scheduled to commission several newly completed projects on the campus.

The extensive convocation programme, which includes a mix of academic, religious, and cultural events, will run from Friday, October 17, to Sunday, October 26, 2025, according to a statement released by the University Registrar, Mr. Mansur Alfanla.

A key academic event will be the Convocation Lecture, set for Wednesday, October 22, at the University Auditorium. The lecture, titled "The Gen-Z Playbook: Navigating Work and the Real World," will be delivered by former Lagos State Governor and immediate past Minister of Works and Housing, Mr. Babatunde Raji Fashola, SAN.

Mr. Alfanla confirmed that President Tinubu’s visit will coincide with the Investiture of Emeritus Professors and the commissioning of projects on Thursday, October 23, at 1:30 p.m. The Registrar noted that the new projects underscore the institution’s commitment to "steady growth and commitment to excellence."

The 40th Convocation week will officially kick off with a Special Juma’at Service on Friday, October 17, followed by an Interdenominational Church Service on Sunday, October 19.

The University’s milestones will be outlined on Monday, October 20, when the Vice-Chancellor, Prof. Wahab Egbewole, SAN, addresses a World Press Conference.

The academic ceremonies are segmented by programme:

* Wednesday, October 22: Graduands of four-year and diploma programmes will be conferred with their degrees immediately following the convocation lecture.
* Thursday, October 23: Students of five and six-year programmes, alongside postgraduate graduands, will have their ceremonies, which will also feature the Staff Merit Awards and Convocation Luncheon.

Other events include the convocation play, "Joromi," on Tuesday, October 21. The ceremonies will conclude with a final Special Juma’at Service on Friday, October 24, and a Thanksgiving Service on Sunday, October 26.

Mr. Alfanla assured that all necessary logistics and security arrangements have been put in place to ensure a hitch-free event, urging all graduands and guests to maintain orderliness.

"This 40th Convocation is a celebration of excellence and a reaffirmation of UNILORIN’s position as a leading centre of learning in Nigeria and beyond," the Registrar stated, noting that the event is expected to draw dignitaries, scholars, and alumni from across the nation.

The Joint Admissions and Matriculation Board (JAMB) has screened 176 exceptional underage candidates who excelled in the 2025 Unified Tertiary Matriculation Examination (UTME), as deliberations intensify at the National Assembly over a potential review of Nigeria’s minimum admission age policy.

The nationwide screening exercise, held concurrently in Abuja, Lagos, and Owerri, was designed to assess the readiness, competence, and intellectual maturity of candidates below 16 years seeking university admission for the 2025/2026 academic session.

Each candidate underwent a written test and an oral interview, allowing evaluators to measure both academic strength and personal development.

Speaking at the Abuja Centre, Professor Taoheed Adedoja, Chairman of the Screening Panel, praised the smooth conduct of the exercise and commended the impressive performance of the candidates. He explained that the evaluation process was multi-tiered, combining written assessments with direct interaction to ensure a fair and comprehensive appraisal.

Of the 176 participants nationwide, 22 candidates were screened in Abuja, while others took part in Lagos and Owerri centres.

Monitoring the exercise, Senator Mohammed Muntari Dandutse, Chairman of the Senate Committee on Tertiary Institutions and TETFund, lauded JAMB for providing a credible platform to identify and nurture exceptional young minds. He reaffirmed the National Assembly’s commitment to supporting President Bola Tinubu’s education reform agenda, describing the initiative as a step towards building a knowledge-driven economy.

Similarly, Hon. Oboku Oforji, Chairman of the House Committee on Basic Examination Bodies, commended the brilliance of the young candidates, calling them “proof of Nigeria’s emerging academic strength within Africa.” He revealed that the Committee is considering a review of the current admission age policy to make room for gifted underage students, while pledging continued legislative backing for JAMB and related agencies.

According to officials, the exercise reflects JAMB’s dedication to merit, excellence, and inclusivity, ensuring that all candidates regardless of age are given equal opportunities to demonstrate their academic potential and preparedness for tertiary education.

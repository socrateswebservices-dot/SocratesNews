The Nigerian Education Loan Fund (NELFUND) has issued a crucial directive to all accredited tertiary institutions nationwide, requiring them to immediately update and upload the comprehensive records of all their students both new admissions and returning undergraduates into the NELFUND Student Verification Portal.

This proactive step is essential to ensure a seamless verification and loan application process before the official opening of the NELFUND portal for the 2025/2026 academic session.

NELFUND has emphasized that this data submission is mandatory for student eligibility. Only students whose details have been duly uploaded and verified by their respective institutions will be eligible to apply for and benefit from the national student loan scheme.

Institutions are specifically required to ensure that each student's data is accurately captured and uploaded using their admission number or any other unique and verifiable identifier.

The Fund stressed the vital role tertiary institutions play in the success of the scheme, urging them to commence and complete the upload process promptly. Institutions are advised to designate appropriate officers to oversee this critical exercise in line with provided technical guidelines.

NELFUND stated that this high level of cooperation is key to "ensuring that no eligible student is left behind" as the agency prepares to launch its application process for the new academic year, thereby expanding access to higher education for all eligible Nigerian students.

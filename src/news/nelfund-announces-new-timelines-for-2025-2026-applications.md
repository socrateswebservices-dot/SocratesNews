NELFUND has announced that its 2024/2025 loan application portal will close on September 30, 2025, marking the end of the current application cycle. The portal is set to reopen in the second week of October 2025 for the 2025/2026 session and will remain open until January 2026.\

Upkeep payments for the current session will continue until November 2025, but students wishing to access the new cycle will need to reapply. Institutions are required to submit updated student records before the deadline as any unverified applications will be cancelled.\

Managing Director Akintunde Sawyerr emphasized the Fund’s commitment to removing financial barriers for students and encouraged institutions to act promptly to ensure their students’ applications are verified. Applicants are advised to carefully review all the detailed information provided in the official announcement images to avoid missing deadlines.

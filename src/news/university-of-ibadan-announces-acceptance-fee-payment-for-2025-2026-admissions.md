The University of Ibadan (UI) has officially announced the commencement of the non-refundable acceptance fee payment for candidates offered admission for the 2025/2026 UTME and Direct Entry academic session. Successful candidates are required to pay a sum of Fifty Thousand Naira (N50,000.00).

The announcement, released by the Registrar, G.O. Saliu Manupa, indicates that the payment portal will be accessible via the University Admission Portal at www.admissions.ui.edu.ng from Monday, November 10, 2025, until Friday, December 05, 2025. The university explicitly stated that there will be no extension of this deadline.

Candidates who have already been offered admission and have generated their admission letters on the Central Admission Processing System (CAPS) must proceed to pay the acceptance fee before the December 5th deadline.

Crucially, candidates who are yet to generate their admission letters are strongly advised to do so before paying the acceptance fee. The university also noted that requests for a refund of the acceptance fee will not be entertained.

Alongside the fee payment, candidates must upload the following documents:

* O/L result(s)
* PIN/SERIAL Numbers of WAEC/NECO scratch card for O/L results

Payment can be made using two options:

* Card Payment: Credit/Debit Card Payment using ATM card.
* Bank Branch Payment: Candidates can pay Cash at any bank by using the print-out from the admission portal. Following payment at the bank, candidates must log in to the admission portal to reconcile their bank branch payment.

All candidates are advised to print their payment success receipt for future reference.

The university highlighted several important notes regarding the next steps in the admission process:

* Credential Clearance: Upon payment of the acceptance fee, candidates are expected to present the originals of their credentials to designated Schedule Officers in the Undergraduate Admissions Office for clearance. The date for this exercise will be communicated later.
* Matriculation: Candidates who successfully complete the clearance exercise will be matriculated as bona-fide students of the university.
* Admission Withdrawal Clause: The university reserves the right to withdraw the admission of any candidate if it is discovered, at the clearance exercise or any other time, that they gained admission with insufficient, irregular, or inauthentic credentials.

All admitted candidates are urged to adhere strictly to the payment deadline and follow the instructions to secure their slot for the 2025/2026 academic session.

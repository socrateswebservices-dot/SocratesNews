The Academic Staff Union of Universities (ASUU) has suspended its ongoing two-week comprehensive warning strike, signaling an expected return to academic activities in public universities across the country.

The suspension was announced by the National President of the union, Prof. Chris Piwuna, during a press briefing held on Wednesday morning in Abuja.

The decision was reached after the union's National Executive Council (NEC) concluded an overnight meeting that stretched into the early hours of Wednesday, ending around 4:00 a.m. The NEC reviewed the progress achieved in its recent discussions with the Federal Government.

Prof. Piwuna explained that while the union still has outstanding issues, the engagements with government representatives on the draft renegotiation of the 2009 FGN-ASUU agreement showed progress.

“We’ve had useful engagements... Although more work still needs to be done, we are not where we were before the commencement of the strike,” Piwuna stated.

The initial strike, declared on Monday, October 13, was a protest against the government’s delay in addressing several core demands, including:

* Conclusion of the renegotiated 2009 FGN-ASUU agreement.
* Payment of three and a half months’ withheld salaries.
* Payment of outstanding 25–35% salary arrears.
* Release of withheld third-party deductions (cooperative contributions, union dues).
* Revitalisation of public universities.
* An end to the alleged victimisation of lecturers in certain institutions.

The union leader added that the NEC decided to suspend the action to "reciprocate the efforts of well-meaning Nigerians," including appeals from students, parents, and the Nigeria Labour Congress (NLC).

Academic activities are now expected to resume immediately as ASUU awaits further action from the Federal Government on the remaining demands.

The Legal Unit of the Obafemi Awolowo University (OAU), Ile-Ife, has raised concerns over the legitimacy of a letter submitted by Hon. Kene Nnadi, counsel to a group of applicants challenging the ongoing admission process involving the University of Lagos (UNILAG), OAU, and the Joint Admissions and Matriculation Board (JAMB).

The query follows an interim order issued by the Federal High Court, Enugu, directing the three institutions to maintain the current status quo regarding the 2025/2026 admission list pending the determination of the substantive motion.

In a letter dated October 4, 2025, and referenced VC/DLS.093/VOL. I/001, OAU’s Director of Legal Services, *Yinka Ayantola, Esq.*, noted that the seal attached to Hon. Nnadi’s correspondence bore his 2024 Nigerian Bar Association (NBA) seal rather than the 2025 seal required for current legal practice.

The university’s Legal Unit reminded the lawyer of his professional obligation to pay the annual practicing fee before acting in his legal capacity and requested proof of his eligibility to practice law for the 2025 legal year.

> “I have the instructions of the University to request you to do the needful,” the letter stated.

The correspondence was copied to the Vice-Chancellor, Deputy Vice-Chancellor (Academic), Registrar, Chairman of the Committee of Deans, and the Director of Academic Affairs.

Earlier, Justice T. Segun-Bello of the Federal High Court had ordered all parties involved in the dispute to maintain the existing status quo pending the hearing of the substantive motion on notice.

The suit was filed by five applicants — Chibuzor Success, Oyeleye Zainab Ayomide, Adedeji John Samuel, Monsura Aliat Aduragbemi, and Bassey Daniel Nsikak — on behalf of other affected candidates. The case has been adjourned to October 28, 2025, for hearing.

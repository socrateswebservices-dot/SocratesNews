The Academic Staff Union of Universities (ASUU) has announced plans to embark on a two-week nationwide warning strike beginning Monday, October 13, 2025, following the expiration of its 14-day ultimatum to the Federal Government over unresolved issues affecting Nigerian universities.

The decision was contained in a memo titled “Strike Bulletin One” and signed by ASUU National President, Prof. Chris Piwuna, which was circulated to all branch chairpersons and obtained by journalists in Abuja.

According to the memo, the strike action follows the government’s alleged failure to take satisfactory steps to address long-standing issues, including the renegotiation and implementation of the 2009 ASUU-FGN Agreement, funding for university revitalisation, payment of outstanding salary arrears, and the resolution of promotion and third-party deduction issues.

Prof. Piwuna stated that the decision to proceed with the warning strike was reached at the National Executive Council (NEC) meeting held on September 28, 2025, at the University of Abuja, after evaluating the results of referendums conducted across various branches.

> “It was further resolved that the union will embark on a two-week warning strike if the government fails to take acceptable and satisfactory steps to address the lingering issues,” the statement read.

He lamented that despite the expiration of the ultimatum and repeated communication with the Ministers of Labour and Education and the Nigeria Labour Congress (NLC), the government has not made any meaningful progress.

> “I regret to inform you that there is no meaningful development deserving any consideration to be reported. The goal of our current action remains to compel the government to sign and implement the renegotiated agreement document, among other demands,” Piwuna said.

The ASUU President commended members for their patience and resilience throughout what he described as an “eight-year tortuous negotiation process”, urging full mobilisation and unity among members nationwide.

> “We are strong when we organise, but weakened when we agonise. The days ahead call for mobilisation of every member of our union to ensure unity of purpose,” he added.

ASUU directed its members to take instructions only from branch chairpersons and maintain communication through official union channels to prevent misinformation.

Meanwhile, Mrs. Folasade Boriowo, spokesperson for the Federal Ministry of Education, said updates on the government’s response would be provided “when available.”

In its communiqué, ASUU listed unresolved issues including:

* The signing and implementation of the 2009 FGN-ASUU renegotiated agreement.
* Sustainable funding for university revitalisation.
* Payment of outstanding 25–35 per cent salary arrears.
* Resolution of promotion arrears and third-party deduction issues.
* Addressing the victimisation of lecturers in some federal universities.

The union insisted that the Federal Government has the capacity to avert the strike by taking concrete and verifiable steps toward fulfilling its commitments.

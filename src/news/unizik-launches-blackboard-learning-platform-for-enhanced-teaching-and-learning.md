The management of Nnamdi Azikiwe University (UNIZIK) has officially introduced the Blackboard Learning Management System (LMS) as its new digital platform for teaching, learning, and access to academic resources.

According to the University, the Blackboard LMS is designed to improve students‚Äô learning experience by providing a centralized space for academic activities. Through the platform, students can access lecture notes and course materials, submit assignments, take quizzes, engage in discussions, and communicate directly with lecturers and classmates.

To ensure a smooth transition, all students are required to complete a mandatory ‚ÄúStudent Orientation Course‚Äù on the Blackboard LMS. The orientation is intended to familiarize students with the platform‚Äôs features and guide them on how to use it effectively.

#### Orientation Course Details (For Students Only)

* Course Name: Student Orientation Course
* Course ID: StudentOrientation-181

#### Steps for Self-Enrollment

1. Visit the Blackboard portal via <https://unizik-blackboard.teras.ng>
2. Log in with your UNIZIK email (Username) and password `P@sswOrd@Unizik`

5. Search for StudentOrientation-181

The Nigerian Education Loan Fund (NELFUND) has officially announced the opening of its student loan application portal for the 2025/2026 academic session, with applications scheduled to run from Thursday, October 23, 2025, through Saturday, January 31, 2026.

The announcement, contained in a statement signed by Mrs. Oseyemi Oluwatuyi, Director, Strategic Communications for NELFUND, comes as a vital update to students eagerly awaiting financial support for the new session.

| ---------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Portal Opening Date    | Thursday, October 23, 2025                                                         |
| Portal Closing Date    | Saturday, January 31, 2026                                                         |
| Eligible Students      | Returning and newly admitted students of accredited tertiary institutions.         |
| Student Identification | Fresh students may apply using their Admission Number or JAMB Registration Number. |

NELFUND stressed that the successful rollout depends heavily on the continued cooperation of tertiary institutions nationwide. Institutions are reminded that they must update and upload the verified records of both returning and newly admitted students on the NELFUND Student Verification Portal.

This pre-application step is mandatory, as the Fund reiterated a crucial point: only students whose details have been duly uploaded and verified by their institutions will be eligible to apply for and benefit from the scheme.

NELFUND also addressed potential issues that could affect students:

* Institutional Flexibility: Institutions are "encouraged to show understanding" in enforcing registration and fee payment deadlines for students awaiting loan disbursement.
* Special Notice: Institutions that have not yet commenced their 2025/2026 academic session should formally notify NELFUND to schedule flexibility for their students.

Mrs. Oluwatuyi appealed to all institutions to consider temporary registration measures for students whose loan applications are being processed, ensuring that no student loses access to education due to financial constraints.

For further inquiries, students and institutions are directed to reach NELFUND through their official channels listed on the official website.

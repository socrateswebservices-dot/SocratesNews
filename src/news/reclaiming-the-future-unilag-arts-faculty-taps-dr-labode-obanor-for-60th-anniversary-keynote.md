The Faculty of Arts at the University of Lagos (UNILAG) has announced that Dr. LaBode Obanor, President of the League for Social Justice (LSJ), will deliver the keynote address for its 60th Anniversary public lecture, scheduled for Thursday, October 23, 2025.

The formal lecture, a central event in the Faculty’s diamond jubilee celebration, will take place at the Faculty of Arts Conference Room, University of Lagos, Akoka.

The chosen lecture topic, “From Knowledge to Justice: Reclaiming the Humanities in Africa’s Tech-Driven Future,” aims to explore the critical role of humanistic studies in navigating Africa’s complex developmental challenges amid rapid technological change.

According to a statement by the Chairman of the Organising Planning Committee, Hon. Francis Shonubi, the keynote is expected to be a major highlight of the week-long celebration, which is themed “Humanities as the Tech Solution to Global Crisis in 21st Century Africa.”

Dr. Obanor, a well-regarded commentator and advocate, is expected to focus on how principles of justice, civic ethics, and youth empowerment must guide the continent's digital transformation to safeguard human dignity and democratic accountability.

Dr. Obanor leads the League for Social Justice (LSJ), a civic movement dedicated to advancing the rule of law, education equity, and participatory democracy. His work centers on policy reform, advocacy, and public education aimed at empowering young people and restoring public trust in institutions.

Commenting ahead of the event, Dr. Obanor stated: “Education is not merely about information; it is about transformation. The humanities remind us that progress without justice is regression.”

The sixtieth anniversary celebration is set to showcase the accomplishments of the Faculty’s distinguished scholars and alumni while providing a platform to reflect on six decades of the Faculty's contribution to national development and its vision for producing the next generation of African thinkers and innovators.

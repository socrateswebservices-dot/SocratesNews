The Federal Government has escalated its response to the ongoing nationwide strike by the Academic Staff Union of Universities (ASUU), directing all Vice-Chancellors (VCs) of federal universities to immediately and strictly enforce the "No Work, No Pay" policy.

The firm directive was communicated via a circular dated October 13, 2025, signed by the Minister of Education, Dr. Tunji Alausa. The circular, a copy of which was seen by PUNCH Online, signals the government's dissatisfaction with the continuation of the industrial action despite what it described as repeated calls for dialogue.

The Ministry of Education emphasized that non-compliance with labour laws will no longer be tolerated. The circular explicitly states: “In line with the provisions of the Labour Laws of the Federation, the Federal Government reiterates its position on the enforcement of the ‘No Work, No Pay’ policy in respect of any employee who fails to discharge his or her official duties during the period of strike action.”

Dr. Alausa has mandated VCs to immediately conduct a roll call and physical headcount of academic staff. Universities are required to submit comprehensive reports identifying staff members who are present and performing their duties versus those absent due to the strike. Salary payments will be withheld for staff confirmed to be on strike.

Copies of the circular were distributed to key government and university officials, including the Head of the Civil Service, the Accountant-General of the Federation, and the Executive Secretary of the National Universities Commission (NUC). The NUC, in turn, has been tasked with monitoring compliance and submitting a consolidated report to the ministry within seven days.

The current ASUU strike, which also commenced on Monday, October 13, was launched in protest of several unresolved issues. These core demands include the finalization of the renegotiated 2009 FGN-ASUU agreement, payment of withheld salaries, sustained funding and revitalization of public universities, and the cessation of the victimisation of lecturers in select universities.

Additionally, the union is demanding the payment of outstanding 25-35% salary arrears, promotion arrears spanning over four years, and the release of withheld third-party deductions, such as cooperative contributions and union check-off dues.

In a clarification, the Minister noted that members of other academic bodies, specifically the Congress of University Academics (CONUA) and the National Association of Medical and Dental Academics (NAMDA), who are not participating in the strike, will be exempt from the salary deductions.

Dr. Alausa concluded the directive by urging university heads to treat the matter with "utmost urgency and a deep sense of responsibility in national interest." The enforcement of the "No Work, No Pay" policy sets the stage for a major confrontation between the government and the striking union.

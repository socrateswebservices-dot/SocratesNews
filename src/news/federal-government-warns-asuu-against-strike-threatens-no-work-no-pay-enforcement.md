The Federal Government on Sunday cautioned the Academic Staff Union of Universities (ASUU) against proceeding with its planned nationwide strike, explicitly threatening to invoke the "no work, no pay" policy should academic activities be disrupted.

The warning comes on the heels of ASUU's declaration of a total and comprehensive warning strike set to commence on Monday, October 13, 2025.

In a statement signed by Mrs. Folasade Boriowo, spokesperson for the Federal Ministry of Education, the government expressed disappointment that ASUU chose to proceed with industrial action despite what it described as ongoing efforts to address the union’s grievances.

The Federal Government reaffirmed its commitment to improving staff welfare and ensuring academic stability under President Bola Ahmed Tinubu's Renewed Hope Agenda.

"The Ministers further stressed that the government has continued to prioritise the welfare of university staff and the stability of the academic calendar," the statement read.

While urging ASUU to embrace dialogue as the most effective and sustainable means of resolving disputes, the Ministry emphasized that the government remains open to continuous engagement with stakeholders to maintain peace and progress in tertiary institutions.

However, the Ministry was firm on its stance, reiterating that the "no work, no pay" policy is a subsisting labour law in Nigeria and will be strictly enforced if the strike proceeds.

"While the government continues to demonstrate goodwill and flexibility in addressing legitimate concerns, it will not shirk its responsibility to ensure fairness, accountability, and prudent management of public resources," the statement added.

The government also appealed to all academic unions to pursue constructive partnership over confrontation and reassured students, parents, and the public of its dedication to sustaining industrial harmony and enhancing the quality of higher education.

ASUU's decision to strike stems from the government's persistent failure to meet several long-standing demands. The union's primary grievances that triggered the walkout include:

* The conclusion of the renegotiated 2009 FGN–ASUU Agreement.
* Payment of three and a half months of withheld salaries and outstanding 25–35% salary arrears.
* Settlement of promotion arrears spanning four years.
* Sustainable funding for public universities.
* Immediate release of withheld third-party deductions, including cooperative contributions and union check-off dues.
* An end to the alleged victimisation of lecturers at Lagos State University (LASU), Prince Abubakar Audu University, and the Federal University of Technology, Owerri (FUTO).

The impending strike casts a shadow over the start of the new academic week, leaving students and parents anxiously awaiting a resolution.

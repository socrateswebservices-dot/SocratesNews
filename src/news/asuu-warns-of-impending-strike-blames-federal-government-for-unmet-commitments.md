The University of Jos chapter of the Academic Staff Union of Universities (ASUU) has raised fresh concerns over the Federal Government’s continued neglect of its agreements, warning that the union may no longer guarantee the industrial peace maintained in recent years.

At a stakeholders’ meeting held on Friday in Jos, the union’s Students’ Relations Committee engaged directly with student representatives to explain the issues fueling ASUU’s growing frustration and its threat of industrial action.

Chairperson of the UNIJOS ASUU, Professor Jurbe Molwus, who addressed the session, expressed appreciation to the student leaders for their willingness to engage, describing the dialogue as both timely and essential.

According to him, despite maintaining industrial harmony for the past two years, the union has endured prolonged hardships, including unpaid allowances and unfulfilled government promises.

> “ASUU is worried that it may no longer sustain the peace that has prevailed recently. The government might be proud of the calm, but it has come at the expense of our members’ welfare. We have suffered persistent denial of our entitlements,” Molwus said.

He reminded attendees that the union had already issued a 14-day ultimatum that is set to expire on October 13 after which a two-week warning strike may begin if the Federal Government fails to meet its demands. The decision, he noted, was reached during ASUU’s National Executive Council (NEC) meeting on September 28 in Abuja.

ASUU’s demands include the release of the revitalisation fund, the signing and implementation of the 2009 agreement, payment of promotion arrears and responsibility allowances withheld under the IPPIS platform, reinstatement of victimised members, payment of the 23.35% wage award, and the release of three months’ withheld salaries.

Responding on behalf of the students, President of the University of Jos Students’ Union Government (SUG), Miss Jane Pwajok, commended ASUU for the transparency displayed during the meeting. She described the session as an “eye-opener” that gave students a clearer understanding of the issues behind the union’s agitation.

While acknowledging ASUU’s commitment to improving the university system, Pwajok appealed for dialogue-driven strategies that would not disrupt academic activities.

> “We understand ASUU’s sacrifices, but students fear that another strike could destabilise the calendar and prolong our stay in school,” she said.

The meeting ended with both parties reaffirming their shared commitment to the pursuit of quality education, even as tensions continue to rise over the government’s inaction.

In a major policy shift affecting millions of secondary school students, the Federal Government has officially removed Mathematics as a compulsory admission requirement for students seeking entry into Nigerian universities and polytechnics for Arts and Humanities courses.

The new guideline, announced on Tuesday by the Federal Ministry of Education, revises the long-standing requirement that mandated all senior secondary school students regardless of their specialization to obtain a credit pass in Mathematics in the Senior School Certificate Examination (SSCE), administered by both WAEC and NECO.

For decades, Arts and Humanities students were held to the same standard as their Science and Social Science counterparts, requiring five credit passes including both Mathematics and English Language.

The Ministry stated that the policy change is designed to remove unnecessary barriers to tertiary education while simultaneously maintaining academic quality and standards across the system.

According to a statement issued by the Ministry's spokesperson, Folasade Boriowo, the "revised National Guidelines for Entry Requirements into Nigerian Tertiary Institutions" clearly outlines the differentiated subject requirements:

* Universities: A minimum of five credit passes in relevant subjects, including English Language, obtained in not more than two sittings, is required. Mathematics is now mandatory only for Science, Technology, and Social Science courses.
* Polytechnics (National Diploma - ND Level): A minimum of four credit passes in relevant subjects is needed. English Language is mandatory for non-science courses, while Mathematics is required only for science-related programs.
* Polytechnics (Higher National Diploma - HND Level): The requirement remains stringent, demanding a minimum of five credit passes in relevant subjects, which includes both English Language and Mathematics.
* Colleges of Education (NCE Level): Students require a minimum of four credit passes in relevant subjects. English Language is mandatory for Arts and Social Science courses, and Mathematics is required for Science, Vocational, and Technical programs.

The decision is expected to be widely welcomed by students and educators in the Arts and Humanities who have long argued that the blanket Mathematics requirement unnecessarily restricted talented students from pursuing higher education in fields where the subject is not core.

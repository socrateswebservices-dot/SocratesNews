The Academic Staff Union of Universities (ASUU) has confirmed that its nationwide strike will persist, squarely rejecting the Federal Government's threat to enforce a "no-work, no-pay" policy. The union's leadership views the government's stance as an attempt at intimidation, insisting that the industrial action will only cease once longstanding issues plaguing the public university system are adequately addressed.

ASUU Chairman, Dr. Chris Piwuna, described the government's warning as a "veiled threat" that would not deter the union. "We will not be intimidated," Piwuna stated, urging the government to move beyond threats and focus on substantive negotiations.

The Federal Ministry of Education had previously called for a halt to the strike, noting that it had submitted a comprehensive proposal aimed at resolving issues related to staff welfare, working conditions, and institutional governance. The government also maintained that specific demands, such as those concerning appointments and promotions, fall under the purview of university governing councils and should be managed at the institutional level, not through central government negotiation.

However, Dr. Piwuna countered the government's claim, asserting that critical obligations remain unfulfilled. He highlighted significant grievances, including unpaid salary arrears, withheld allowances, and a substantial backlog of payments stemming from the 2022 strike.

"The union has issued multiple notices and engaged the government in talks, but the progress remains woefully insufficient," Piwuna explained. He acknowledged that partial payments of earned academic allowances were received but stressed that they "fall short of the full amounts owed to lecturers nationwide."

The latest industrial action, a two-week warning strike which began on Monday, October 13, follows a series of repeated failed negotiations. The core issues driving the strike revolve around inadequate funding, weak institutional autonomy, and insufficient remuneration for academic staff.

This fresh confrontation evokes painful memories of previous disruptions, most notably the protracted eight-month industrial action in 2022, which severely disrupted academic calendars and triggered widespread student protests across the nation.

ASUU has engaged in several strikes over the past decade, consistently citing the government's failure to honor previous agreements. The union remains resolute, indicating that without concrete action on their demands, the education sector faces yet another period of uncertainty.

The Nigeria Labour Congress (NLC) has given the Federal Government four weeks to resolve all lingering issues with university unions, including ASUU.

NLC President Joe Ajaero warned that if negotiations fail, the Congress will mobilize a nationwide strike across all sectors.

He also slammed the government’s *“no work, no pay”* stance, saying it’s now “no pay, no work.”

ASUU remains on strike over unpaid salaries, poor university funding, and unfulfilled agreements dating back to 2009.\
While the government claims to have released intervention funds, the union insists the efforts are not enough.

The NLC reaffirmed its total support for ASUU and urged the government to honour all agreements and prioritize the welfare of academic staff.

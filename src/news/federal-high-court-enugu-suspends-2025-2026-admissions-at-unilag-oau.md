The Federal High Court sitting in Enugu has issued an interim order directing the University of Lagos (UNILAG), Obafemi Awolowo University (OAU), and the Joint Admissions and Matriculation Board (JAMB) to maintain the status quo concerning the 2025/2026 academic session admissions.

The order was granted following a motion without notifying the other party filed on September 25, 2025, by five applicants: Chibuzor Success, Oyeleye Zainab Ayomide, Adedeji John Samuel, Monsura Aliat Aduragbemi, and Bassey Daniel Nsikak on behalf of themselves and other affected candidates of the 2025 UNILAG and OAU post-UTME exercise.

In their application, the plaintiffs sought for temporary court ban restraining the respondents from releasing, approving, uploading, or finalizing any admission list pending the hearing and determination of the substantive motion on notice. They also urged the court to restrain JAMB from processing or validating any final admission list submitted by the two universities.

At the hearing, counsel for the applicants, F. K. Nnadi Esq., appearing with G. C. Nnamani Esq., moved the motion as filed.

In his ruling, the presiding judge, Hon. Justice T. Segun-Bello, held that the suit raised serious and triable issues that warranted a hearing from both parties. Accordingly, the court ordered that the respondents be placed on notice and directed all parties to maintain the current state of affairs regarding the 2025/2026 admissions until the substantive motion is determined.

The case was adjourned to October 28, 2025, for hearing.\
The order, dated September 30, 2025, was issued under the seal of the Federal High Court, Enugu, and signed by the Registrar, Nwaukwa Ukamaka C.
